# Amazing Subtitle Burn-in-ator (for Mac)

Oh my. This provides a friendly Mac GUI interface for burning in subtitles to videos using ffmpeg. Requires Mac OS Mavericks or higher, I think.

This was built to solve the problem of not-super-tech instructional technologists being faced with the annoying difficult task of burning subtitles into a video. It's insane that we don't have a friendly, free GUI for this simple task. So I built one. It's a bit janky and hacky, but it works.

`index.html` is the main interface; `app.js` is the main application code. Check 'em out.

## usage

Quick start: download it [here](http://cylesoft.com/downloads/subtitle-burninator.zip) and unzip it, and open up `run-me` !

More advanced:

1. Clone the repo somewhere.
2. Download nw.js here: http://nwjs.io/ and download the "OSX64" version.
3. Unzip it, put it in the same folder as the code you just cloned.
4. Download ffmpeg built for OS X here: http://evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/ (2.5.3 was used in development)
5. Side note: you may need something like [The Unarchiver](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-unarchiver/id425424353?mt=12) to do the next step.
6. Unzip the ffmpeg 7-zip file, put the resulting `ffmpeg` file in the same folder as the code you just cloned.
7. In the folder with all the code and ffmpeg and nwjs, run `nwjs` ! That's it.
